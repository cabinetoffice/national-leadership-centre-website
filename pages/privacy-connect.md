This is the privacy notice for the use of the National Leadership Centre's websites and online services. If you are looking for our privacy statement for handling network members' personal data, please click here: nationalleadership.gov.uk/privacy-network

*******



Connect.NationalLeadership.gov.uk and www.NationalLeadership.gov.uk are provided by the National Leadership Centre (NLC), part of the Cabinet Office.

Cabinet Office is the data controller the pages starting with www.NationalLeadership.gov.uk or Connect.NationalLeadership.gov.uk. Where these pages link out to services provided by other departments, agencies and local authorities (like www.gov.uk), their own privacy policies will apply. These are managed separately by each service provider.

A data controller determines how and why personal data is processed. For more information, read the Cabinet Office’s entry in the [Data Protection Public Register.](https://ico.org.uk/ESDWebPages/Entry/Z7414053)

The legal basis for processing all other personal data is that it’s necessary to perform a task in the public interest.

All personal data is stored in the European Economic Area (EEA). Google Analytics data may be transferred outside the EEA, but this cannot be used to personally identify you.

We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your data secure. We have set up systems and processes to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure of your data – for example, we protect your data using varying levels of encryption.

We also make sure that any third parties that we deal with keep all personal data they process on our behalf secure.

You can also:

* raise an objection about how your personal data is processed
