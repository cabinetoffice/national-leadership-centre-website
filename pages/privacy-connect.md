This is the privacy notice for the use of the National Leadership Centre's websites and online services. If you are looking for our privacy statement for handling network members' personal data, please click here: nationalleadership.gov.uk/privacy-network

Connect.NationalLeadership.gov.uk and www.NationalLeadership.gov.uk are provided by the National Leadership Centre (NLC), part of the Cabinet Office.

Cabinet Office is the data controller the pages starting with www.NationalLeadership.gov.uk or Connect.NationalLeadership.gov.uk. Where these pages link out to services provided by other departments, agencies and local authorities (like www.gov.uk), their own privacy policies will apply. These are managed separately by each service provider.

A data controller determines how and why personal data is processed. For more information, read the Cabinet Office’s entry in the [Data Protection Public Register.](https://ico.org.uk/ESDWebPages/Entry/Z7414053)
