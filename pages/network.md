We are creating a network that connects the most senior public service leaders from across every sector and region. This will include:

* Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) in the National Health Service 
* CEOs of Ambulance Trusts
* University Vice Chancellors
* Heads of large Further Education Institutions and Academy Chains
* Local Authority CEOs
* Police Chief Constables
* Fire Chiefs
* Permanent Secretaries and Director Generals
* Three star officers in the Military

Helping leaders build connections will help them share ideas, ask for help from their peer group, and work together to tackle strategic problems that need a multi-organisation response.

## Events across the country

We will bring leaders together through national, regional and small group events, making time for peers to work together to address the problems that are most pressing in their daily leadership and business.

## Connecting on a digital service

Ahead of the leadership programme starting, we will allow our network to access a private area of our website. In this section, they’ll be able to connect with each other, find cutting edge research, and - for our programme delegates - see the resources and pre-reading for their residential courses.

## International peers

The challenges we are facing in this country are mirrored in countries throughout the world. Our priorities may have been successfully addressed in other places, and we will have experience to share internationally as well. This is why the NLC, in partnership with the British Council, will host an international summit for some of the world’s most senior public service leaders in 2020. This prestigious event will bring together people from around 50 countries to discuss approaches to common challenges and share best practice.
