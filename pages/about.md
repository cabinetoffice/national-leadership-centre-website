The National Leadership Centre (NLC) has three key objectives:

1. Deliver a flagship leadership programme for around 100 senior public service leaders each year

2. Create a digital platform to enable a thriving network of peer-learning and support for over 1,500 public sector leaders

3. Lead high quality research to develop a better understanding of the relationships between leadership, well-being and productivity

The Public Services Leadership Taskforce was commissioned in October 2017 to explore the challenges faced by the leaders of our public services. 

[The Taskforce made a number of recommendations in their report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-leadership-centre) and, in response, the government created the National Leadership Centre to support leaders of public services in England to improve the services they run.
