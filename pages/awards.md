The National Leadership Centre Award for Public Services recognises the success of leaders and organisations who are working across systems to tackle public service challenges in a complex environment. 

The Award will be won by a cross-sector team who show how their collaboration across systems has delivered demonstrable improvements in outcomes for citizens. 

Particular attention will be given to nominations which show innovation and creativity in their approach to delivering a project. Attention will also be given to projects that are led in a purposefully inclusive way, reflecting the diversity of our citizens and which engage others using pride and passion for public service. 

The nomination must relate to a project or team in England that started on or after the 1 January 2017 with representation from across a minimum of two public service organisations.

## How to nominate

Nominations should be no longer than two pages, and cover the following headings:

* description of the project and the user need being met
* team composition
* evidence of successful outcomes
* barriers encountered
* lessons learned
* lead contact for the project who can be contacted for further information if needed

You may like to include a short video (maximum 3 minutes) of a member of the public who benefitted from the cross-sector work of the project or team.
 
Your nomination should be supported by a senior member of staff from within one of the organisations represented in the nominated project.

Nominations should be sent to NLC@CabinetOffice.gov.uk with the email subject line: NLC Award for Public Services - Nomination.

The deadline for nomination is Wednesday 1 January 2020.
