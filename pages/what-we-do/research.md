paragraph_one: The NLC is working with leaders, academics and practitioners to
  bring the best of the available evidence together in one place. It is building
  a deeper understanding of the complex links between leadership, productivity
  and outcomes in public services.
paragraph_two: "The Centre’s initial research suggests that the best way to
  support public sector leaders is to increase their ability to work as a
  system. To do this successfully, the NLC is:"
paragraph_three: "- developing a data-driven picture of public sector
  leadership\r

  - running place-based pilots across the country\r

  - commissioning original, rigorous research\r

  \r

  The portfolio of work that the NLC is delivering will also be monitored and
  evaluated in partnership with an independent supplier.\r

  ## Public service leadership for the 21st Century\r

  \r

  There is no appetite to create a new leadership model to ‘export’ to other
  organisations as a part of this work. Creating new boxes for leaders to tick
  is not the answer. The NLC is developing an approach to leadership that will
  underpin its work, which aims to encourage a more collaborative way of working
  across the whole public service system.\r

  \r

  To do this, the NLC will take a highly iterative approach and seek out the
  best evidence about what works, listening carefully to the senior leaders it
  works with. It will learn from others, developing and collecting new evidence
  to further this field of knowledge.\r

  \r

  The NLC has identified five leadership qualities that appear most relevant
  to its aims and audience. These initial qualities are: adaptive, connected,
  questioning, purposeful and ethical.\r

  \r

  ### Adaptive\r

  \r

  Adaptive leaders are able to change proactively and constantly learn in a
  complex, uncertain and volatile world.\r

  \r

  ### Connected\r

  \r

  Connected leaders are empathic, collaborative thinkers who consistently work
  across organisational boundaries to build strategic relationships across the
  public service.\r

  \r

  ### Questioning\r

  \r

  Questioning leaders are open minded and seek to understand the views and
  experiences of others.\r

  \r

  ### Purposeful\r

  \r

  Purposeful leaders display absolute clarity about their mission and purpose,
  and they are able to see beyond the problems and pressures of the present.\r

  \r

  ### Ethical\r

  \r

  Ethical leaders consistently behave in ways that create trust, and they take
  a long-term, sustainable approach to fulfilling the organisation’s public
  service mission.\r

  \r

  By helping leaders to enhance these qualities, the NLC can help them to
  deepen their impact on the organisations they run, the services they lead, and
  – ultimately – the lives of citizens.\r

  \r

  An iterative approach has to start somewhere. Our starting point has been
  the extensive discussions and interviews that the Public Services Leadership
  Taskforce conducted with senior leaders. In addition to these discussions, the
  NLC has surveyed a range of literature. Since 2013, there have been at least
  nine significant investigations into public service leadership in the 21st
  Century. From analysis of these investigations, supported by wider desk-based
  research, these five leadership qualities were identified because they appear
  most immediately relevant to the National Leadership Centre’s aims and
  audience"
