paragraph_two: >-
  Within these categories, membership depends on the scale of an organisation,
  amount of public funding and how many citizens it serves.


  Research shows that the higher ranking a leader becomes, the more potential there is for that person to become exposed and isolated in their role. Supporting leaders to build cross-sector connections gives them the opportunity to share ideas, ask for help from their peer group, and work together to tackle strategic problems that need a multi-agency response

paragraph_four: "## Events across the country\r

  \r

  The National Leadership Centre brings leaders together through national,
  regional and small group events. This allows peers to make time, outside
  formal governance or partnership structures, to work together to address the
  most complex and pressing problems that they face."

paragraph_five: "## International peers\r

  \r

  The public service challenges we face are mirrored in countries throughout
  the world. Some of our priorities may have already been addressed successfully
  abroad, and our leaders will have valuable experience to share with
  international colleagues.\r

  \r

  This is why the National Leadership Centre, in partnership with the [British
  Council,](https://www.britishcouncil.org/) will host an international summit
  for some of the world’s most senior public service leaders in 2021.\r

  \r

  This prestigious event will bring together people from around 50 countries
  to discuss approaches to common challenges and share best practice."
