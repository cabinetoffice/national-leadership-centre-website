		<p class="h3-style"><a href="https://twitter.com/Child_Leeds">Child Friendly Leeds</a> is a collaboration to make the city centre of Leeds more welcoming and engaging for young people, and was led by the local authority along with a wide range of other organisations — from schools and libraries, to cultural institutions and businesses. </p>

		<ul>
			<li>A new all-day countywide bus ticket for young people.</li>
			<li>Development of a city centre map especially for young people.</li>
			<li>‘Child Friendly Leeds Sundays’ throughout the summer holidays, with a range of free activities, and a children’s festival.</li>

Over 6,000 children participated in the activities in summer 2018, having a transformational impact on the city centre.

In selecting Child Friendly Leeds as the winner the judges looked for collaboration between different organisations, innovation, inclusivity, demonstrable outcomes for citizens and pride in public service.

<p class="no-margin">Other short-listed projects were:</p>

- [The Veterans Passport](https://www.stockport.nhs.uk/news_13449): a collaboration between health and social care providers to help veterans experience a more joined-up service, with a reduced need to repeat their case history.
- [One Rochdale Health and Care](https://twitter.com/OneRochdaleHC): empowered citizens to decide priority areas of health and social care. Then leaders from multiple organisations collaborated to create local multi-skilled teams in these areas. This has led to a reduction in hospital transfers, and time spent in hospital.
- [Lincoln City Centre Homelessness Project](https://www.lincoln.gov.uk/downloads/file/811/lincolnshire-rough-sleeping-strategy-2019-to-2021): A multi-agency approach to support vulnerable individuals, connecting them seamlessly to the right services.
