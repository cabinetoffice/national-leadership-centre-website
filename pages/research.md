We have identified five leadership qualities that are most relevant to our network: adaptive, connected, questioning, purposeful and ethical.

By helping leaders to enhance these qualities, we can help them to deepen their impact on the organisations they run, the services they lead, and – ultimately – the lives of citizens.

## Adaptive 
Adaptive leaders are able to change proactively and constantly learn in a complex, uncertain and volatile world.

## Connected
Connected leaders are empathic, collaborative thinkers who consistently work across organisational boundaries to build strategic relationships across the public service.

## Questioning
Questioning leaders are open minded and seek to understand the views and experiences of others. 

## Purposeful
Purposeful leaders display absolute clarity about their mission and purpose, and they are able to see beyond the problems and pressures of the present.

## Ethical
Ethical leaders consistently behave in ways that engender trust, and they take a long-term, sustainable approach to fulfilling the organisation’s public service mission.

It is important to note that these qualities do not constitute another leadership model, and they are not set in stone. They are an initial set of qualities that the Centre will seek to develop and enhance through its leadership interventions, and we will work closely with senior leaders to refine them over time.

## Objectives and activities

We are becoming a global hub of leadership data and high quality research. Through this work, we will better understand public sector leadership and its impact on socio-economic wellbeing. 

We are working together with academics and practitioners to take the best of the available evidence, building a deeper understanding of the complex links between leadership, productivity and outcomes in public services. 

We believe that the best way we can support these leaders is to increase their ability to work as a system. To do this successfully, we are developing a comprehensive data-driven picture of public sector leadership, working with leaders through place-based pilots across the country, and commissioning original, rigorous research. 

We are also monitoring and evaluating the NLC’s portfolio of work in partnership with an independent supplier. It is so important that we test, learn and adapt what we do.
