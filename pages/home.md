Public sector leaders make a direct, lasting and profound impact on citizens’ lives. Public service can be immensely fulfilling, but it is not always easy. Leaders tell us that despite their best efforts, they sometimes find themselves frustrated by the level of impact they can achieve.

<p class="gradient-text">
At the National Leadership Centre, we want to help people overcome these constraints to create transformational change across the system.
